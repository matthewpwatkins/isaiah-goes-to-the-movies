Thou, O Israel, art small in stature yet mighty in spirit. Wherefore, I shall catch thee up into the heavens and thou shalt fly like an eagle in battle.

Like a wise counselor in court, thou art set above, and all other nations hate thee. Yet shalt thou triumph over them all and excel greatly. And for thy cunning shalt thou be carried away into the rock. Yea, in the shadow of my hand shall I hide thee, and make thee a polished shaft; in my quiver shall I hide thee,[^isa-49-1] and with thee shall I thrash the nations.[^dc-35-9]

But thy dreams shall distress thee. Giants shalt thou consume and behold thine enemy, a fearsome Gentile nation from a strange land. The inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain.[^isa-40-22]. But thou shalt destroy thine enemy, and shall make his land a desolate waste, for the gate of thy foe is beneath thee.

Yet though thou shalt smite the Gentiles, thou shalt not find peace until they also be recovered at thy hand.

[^isa-49-1]: Isaiah 49:1
[^dc-35-9]: D&C 35:9
[^isa-40-22]: Isaiah 40:22
