The servant hath lost favor in the eyes of the Lord, wherefore he shall be removed out of his place. For a robber shall come upon him and shall slay him, and his fall shall be great, and his people shall not mourn him.

And the thief shall take his chariot and his beasts and his gorgeous attire and all his house with it. And he cometh to the fortress and the ice floweth down at his presence and all the household shall be subject to him.

But the Lord shall stretch out his hand and afflict the thief with a great cursing. He bowels shall swell and grow heavy, and he shall quickly wax old like a garment. His friends shall turn from him and his children are taken away and he is imprisoned because of his sore curse, and he is left unto himself, a lone man in the north country.

But when he shall be humbled and submit himself to the work which the Lord shall appoint him, then shall he be made great and shall accomplish wonders in the eyes of the people.
