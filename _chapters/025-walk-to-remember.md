How shalt thou be, O my people, when thou art in the midst of the Gentiles? Thou shalt be like unto a fair daughter of Zion, the Gentiles are a heathen lad.

A rebellious lad, an idolater, and a whoremonger is perplexed, and his fathers wist not what to do. And for his sins he is become as a slave, and he shall serve in captivity among the poor and the righteous of my people.

And verily, my people shall be as leaven, and shall purge his wickedness from him, and he is smitten with the daughter of Zion and they who shamed her shall be ashamed.

In that day shall my daughter be glorious, for the Gentile shall plant her feet across both nations, and shall bring the stars to her tent, and shall do all things for her.

Nevertheless, Zio is mournful, for she hath not within herself, and all of Judah and Babylon weep for her, for she is not. And all women shall howl when they hear it.
