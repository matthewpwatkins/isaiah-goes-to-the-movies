Wo, wo, wo unto the house of Israel for the wickedness that is within thee! For thy son is puffed up in his learning, and his brother exalts himself with his wife in their riches. Thy daughter is lifted in vanity and wantonness, and her sister is full of envy. And ye are led together by a gluttonous man of wrath, and his son is a dreamer.

Wherefore, because thou has removed thine heart far from me[^isa-29-13], the Lord shall remove thee far away, and there be a great forsaking in the midst of thee[^isa-6-12]. The anger of the LORD is kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them[^isa-5-25], and thy despair shall come upon thee suddenly, as a tempest, and thy name shall be forgotten as an isle from among all the nations.

With thy craftiness shalt thou seek deliverance all the days of thy life. Tet thou repentest not, therefore, Lord shall not hear they cries, nor shall he deliver thee from thy desert place, and thy plans shall come to nought.

[^isa-29-13]: Isaiah 29:13
[^isa-6-12]: Isaiah 6:12
[^isa-5-25]: Isaiah 5:25
