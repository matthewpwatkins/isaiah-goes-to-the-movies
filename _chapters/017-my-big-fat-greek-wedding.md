Behold, the house of Israel is a proud man that rejoiceth in the city of his fathers but liveth in a strange land. He taketh the Gentile's words out of his own mouth and maketh them his own, and he healeth all manner of afflictions with a curious ointment of sapphires.

But the pride of Jacob shall be turned to mourning, for the daughter of Zion is turned out of the way. She fleeth the table of her father, and she mixeth with the heathen. Yea, the Gentile beguileth her.

Wherefore, Jacob is angered against his daughter, for she hath forsaken the covenant. Nevertheless, his household shall turn upon her with mercy, and his head be turned from the neck.

And because of the mercy of Israel, the Gentile shall repent. Levi shall circumcise him and Israel shall spit upon him, that his wickedness may depart. And they are no more Jew nor Gentile, but are all alike in mine house, saith the Lord.
