Thus saith the Lord, I have heard the mourning of the daughters of Zion. For they are left as a cottage in a vineyard[^isa-1-8], and they are sorely afflicted.

A plague hath gone out of the mouth of the Lord and hath entered into the mouth of their mother, insomuch that she is sick even as Hezekiah[^isa-38-11]. And their father remove I out of their midst all the day long for his labors among the Gentile. And their habitation is filled with blackness.

But behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh![^isa-62-11] And it cometh by my servant whom ye think not.

Thou daughter of Zion shall fall into a pit, yet he shall catch thee. A lion whose eyes are full of fire shall swallow thee, but even in his belly, he shall deliver thee out by the hand.

Thou shalt dance again before the Lord. the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon[^isa-14-8] shall spring up at thy coming, and thou shalt nourish thy mother with thy corn. Thou shalt not be ashamed, O my daughter.

[^isa-1-8]: Isa. 1:8

[^isa-62-11]: Isa. 62:11
[^isa-14-8]: Isa. 14:8
