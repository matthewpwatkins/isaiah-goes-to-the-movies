Wo unto the mighty ones in Israel, for the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is kindled against them, for they beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor[^isa-3-15].

Wherefore, the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and the haughty shall be humbled[^isa-10-33].

And who shall I send to humble the mighty? I will call upon a godly man who despiseth not my people, but pleads for the fatherless. And because he is humble, he shall humble mine enemies saith the Lord.

And he hath no form nor comeliness; and when ye shall see him, there is no beauty that ye should desire him[^isa-53-2]. For he is become as a wild man, he liveth in the desert far from everyany, he feeds in the nests of raptors.

And I shall raise up an Aaron unto him, and they twain shall vex the wicked of my people. But they shall be lifted up in the pride of their eyes. Yea, my servant shall rend his garments with his strength and his spokesman shall trust in his learning.

But inasmuch as they humble themselves before me, I shall strengthen them, and they shall prevail against all mine enemies, and even Pharaoh shall they conquer.

And this is a sign unto my people: my servant is blackness, and his spokesman is a Gentile.

[^isa-3-15]: Isaiah 3:15

[^isa-53-2]: Isaiah 53:2
