I beheld a remnant of the house of Israel, and it was compassed about by the army of Moab, and they did assail her ruthlessly.

And a virgin saw in vision great and noble soldiers from a foreign land. And she did send forth and did plead with them to come and deliver Israel.

And the soldiers came, and they spoke valiantly. And they mocked Moab as a dog to its vomit, and as a sow in the mire, and as a doe without a dam. But when they saw the Moabites, they were affrighted, and did smite the knees, and did flee, for they had never fought any man.

And Moab pitted himself against Israel and the virgin was carried into the wilderness by the dragon. And Israel mourned for her fair daughter and would not be comforted.

And the Lord placed in the bowels of the soliders compassion and power. And they did go forth boldly unto the land of the Moabites and did fall upon them from the sky, and they did smite them with stones, and piercing, thundering fire did come out of their hands.

And they mounted upon a great eagle and returned to Israel. And they made in a single day a great army of the weak and simple of the people, mighty soldiers like unto themselves.

And Moab revenged himself upon Israel, but Israel did buffet the army of Moab and distress them on every hand, and they did flee before the remnant of Israel. And the soldiers were found no more in that land.
