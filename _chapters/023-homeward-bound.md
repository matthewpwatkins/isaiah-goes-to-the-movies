Wo unto my people, O house of Israel, for ye are all alone. For the shepherds are departed, and these three are left. One is lifted up in her vanity, one is unruly, and the other is set as a flint, for he trusteth in his lord. Wherefore, they are scattered; they know not whither I have taken their shepherds, and they are as a wandering bird cast out of the nest.[^isa-16-2]

And their flight shall be as out of Egypt, for they shall traverse the wilderness, and I shall afflict them. The vain one shall fear and shall fall into the deep and be carried away by the waters of my wrath. And I will send bears to devour the spoils of the unruly, and I shall pierce his face with many swords. And even my faithful servant shall be chased by beasts and he shall fall and shall be broken grievously.

Yet notwithstanding they shall be thrown into prison, I will preserve them by the strength of my hand. For they they shall repent: the vain one shall be humbled and the unruly shall learn wisdom and the wise shall be youthful. Wherefore I shall send servants to carry them, and shall make lions to fly from before their face. And they shall be gathered home to their shepherds and shall dwell in peace.

[^isa-16-2]: Isaiah 16:2
