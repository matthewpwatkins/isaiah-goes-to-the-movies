Wo unto you, O house of Israel. For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and hath closed your eyes[^isa-29-10], and ye know not that destruction is come upon you, even upon your gates.

But I will call upon my servant Jacob and shall say unto him, Awake, awake; put on thy strength[^isa-52-1]. And he shall wander to and fro, from the north even unto the south, and he shall cry out for he is desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro[^isa-49-21], placed alone in the midst of the earth.[^isa-5-8]

But it is not good for man to be alone[^gen-2-18]. And my servant shall take unto him a fair maiden, and they twain shall be wanderers in that strange land[^jacob-7-26]. And she shall be full of fury for the sin of my servant against her and shall not be comforted.

Then shall I bring my prophet unto them, and he shall reveal unto them the destruction that is come upon the land. Yet he hath not within himself, and shall perish swiftly.

And Jacob shall repent of his sin, and he shall redeem Israel. And he shall submit to the indignation of the Lord. He shall suffer a great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire[^isa-29-6].

And the glory of the Lord nigh consumeth him. And he shall be laid in his grave, but then shall the Lord work a miracle upon him, and he shall be healed. Yet still my servant is not known unto the house of Israel, for he shall die before they know him.

But I shall command the maiden to write and promise unto her: shalt speak out of the ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.[^isa-29-4]
