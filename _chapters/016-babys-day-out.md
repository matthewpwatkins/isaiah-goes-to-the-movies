Israel have I loved. But her heart is set up to vanity; she loveth "the changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins"[^isa-3-18-22] more than the Lord who redeemeth her.

Wherefore, because she is an unfaithful wife, she shall be sorely smitten. Assyria is even now within her borders, and he shall ravish her house. "And before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and my mother,"[^isa-8-4] he shall be carried away captive.

Yea, in that day "in Rama there shall be a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and will not be comforted."[^jer-31-15]

"Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?"[^isa-49-15] When Israel shall turn her heart to me will I turn my heart to her children. "A new heart also will I give them, and a new spirit will I put within them."[^ezek-36-26]

Yea, I shall make the captive son mighty, even to put Assyria at defiance. Chariots shall I send to carry him, and powerful beasts shall protect him. He shall vex the Assyrian captor, "and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire".[^isa-10-16]

The Assyrian pursueth him even to heaven, but they shall fall because the son of Israel hath opened his mouth. Soldiers shall carry my son with loud songs of rejoicing and Israel shall be comforted.
