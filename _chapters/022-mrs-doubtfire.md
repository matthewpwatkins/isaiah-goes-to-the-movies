My heart has hardened against my people, O house of Israel. Thou art as a man who is lightminded and a deceiver, for the birds do speak his voice, and his children are ruined by his mirthmaking.

And the Lord sayeth unto him: "Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children: But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children,"[^isa-47-8-9] and thy wife be removed from thee. Yea, in that day shalt thou mourn and say "I have lost my children, and am desolate, a captive, and removing to and fro." [^isa-49-21]

But though he mourns, he is a deceiver still, for he weareth the garment which pertaineth not to him, for it is an abomination unto the Lord [^deut-22-5]. And he disfigures his countenance insomuch that he is not known among my people, and he robs his own household.

But his deceit shall not stand, for while he eateth and is drunken the Lord shall suddenly reveal his face to his house and his friends. And they are sore amazed at him and put him out from among them.

Yet when he humbleth himself will the Lord have mercy upon him. Yea, he will restore him to his children and appease his friends, but not all shall be as at first.

Thus shall it be unto thee, O house of Israel, if thou wilt now repent and put away thy wickedness.

[^isa-47-8-9]: Isaiah 47:8-9
[^isa-49-21]: Isaiah 49:21
[^deut-22-5]: Deut. 22:5
