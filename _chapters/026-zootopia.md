Behold I will make Zion my jewel and will remove all enmity from her city. But a deceiver entereth in among them, a wolf in sheep's clothing, who seeketh to destroy my people, O Zion my beloved.

Yet I have not forgotten thee, for I shall raise up a maiden strong a fast, and she shall deliver my people. And she shall take unto her a mighty helper and shall purify his heart before me, and they shall search hither and thither for the deceiver.

And they shall wander from the south and to the east and to the north in a single day. What, is it a small thing unto you that they shall capture lions? Yet I say unto you, that they shall hardly escape mice.

But they shall triumph, and Israel is rejoiced. And the wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together;

And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain.[^isa-11-6-9]

[^isa-11-6-9]: Isaiah 11:6-9
