The Lord saith: Woe unto the kingdom of Babylon, that hath made a metal moon to devour the earth. Woe unto the son of Belial, that weareth a mask of iron and forsaketh his brother.

But I have brought forth a son of Jerusalem, that dwelleth in the wilderness and wieldeth a sword of fire. He learneth from my prophet, that perisheth by the son of Belialâ€™s hand. He delivereth my daughter, that is captive in the metal moon.

He flieth with his friend, that hath a swift eagle. He trusteth in my power, not in his sight. He smiteth the metal moon with his sword and kindleth a fire. He is the one who restoreth the balance and the hope for the world.
