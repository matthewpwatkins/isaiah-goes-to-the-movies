In that day shall secret works be manifest in the eyes of the people. And the worker shall say, truly ye shall see my curious works, but not all. And he shall number the fingers of his hand and shall choose him lads and virgins of report, and his wonders shall he show them, and the young ones shall enter the temple and shall see and hear unspeakable things.

Yet not all are worthy before the Lord. The evil one ariseth out of the pit, and is jealous for their sakes. He shall whisper unto them with a sweet tongue, to tempt them to treachery. And they follow the iniquities of their fathers.

Wherefore, because their hearts are full of mischief, the indignation of the Lord is upon them, and he shall turn their mischief upon their own heads, and on their fathers.

One lad shall the Lord boil alive, for he polluteth the stream of the God of Israel. Another shall he press for her image is expanded in her own eyes. Another shall he grind down unto the dust, for his lofty imaginations.

And another hath sought to purchase the wonders of the Lord with money and will not hear the counsel of any man. Wherefore, because she is prideful above all, the Lord shall cast her into a dark pit. He shall burn her alive with fire, and her father with her.

The final lad is also led astray by his father, insomuch that they both seek to exalt themselves into heaven eagles' wings. Yet shall the lad repent of his folly and altogether spurn the evil one.

Then shall there be rejoicing in the land flowing with milk and honey, and that lad and he shall gain all, for he alone is worthy. And he shall ascend above the mountains, where never man has gone.
