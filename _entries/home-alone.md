Behold, the son of iniquity, who provoketh his kindred to wrath, and desireth to be cut off from their midst. For the Lord shall give him over to his own heart's counsel, and leave him desolate in his dwelling place.

And the son shall be as a lamb among wolves, for the workers of evil shall come against him. They shall compass his house round about, and seek to devour him and his substance.

But the Lord shall not forsake the son utterly, but shall put a new spirit within him. He shall be as a mighty man of war, and shall fight against the workers of evil with cunning and strength. He shall make them to stumble and fall, and flee before him in shame and terror.

And the son shall see the error of his ways, and shall repent of his wickedness. He shall cry unto the Lord for his kindred's sake, and the Lord shall hear his voice.

For in due season, the Lord shall restore his kindred unto him, and they shall come with joy and gladness. They shall wonder at his deeds, and bless him for his deliverance. And they shall dwell together in peace and love
