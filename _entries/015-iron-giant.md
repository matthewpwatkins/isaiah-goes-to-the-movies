Assyria shall assail Israel, and shall send a Caananite soldier and Israel shall be as grasshoppers in his sight. His neck is an iron sinew, and his brow is brass. And he shall work great destruction among my people.

Yet I will cause him to remember not the former things, neither consider the things of old and I will soften his heart unto my chosen people, O house of Israel. And notwithstanding he consumeth their chariots, a little child shall arise and lead him to peaceable things.

But there is mischief in Israel, and their captains are as rabid dogs, and they monger war, and they shall provoke the soldier unto wrath and they are ready to be burned, wherefore their wickedness calleth down fire from the Lord, and he shall smite them.

But a child shall plead for the rebellious ones. Notwithstanding the Lord's judgment is just and cometh from above in fire and burning heat, the soldier shall intercede as a merciful servant and shall take upon him the sins of my people.

Wherefore, the mighty one shall ascend unto the heavens and shall be smitten and sorely bruised of the Lord, and he shall be broken in pieces for the love he hath for my people, O Israel. And Israel shall have his name in remembrance from generation to generation.

But I will call my servant from the North countries, and his bones shall take flesh upon them again, and I will breathe my spirit upon him, and he shall be wonderfully arraigned as in former times.
