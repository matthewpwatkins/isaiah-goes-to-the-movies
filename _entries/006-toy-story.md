Behold, there is none like my servant David. He is a shepherd, and a soldier, and a ruler of my people. Above all the servants, there is none more beloved than he.

Yet a stranger is come from a far place, beyond the Euphrates, even unto the ends of heaven. And the stranger himself knoweth not his provenance, yet he shall be beautiful in the eyes of the people and of the Lord, and shall take the mark of the covenant upon himself.

And David shall be provoked to jealousy, and shall consult himself with soothsayers and be sore afflicted. In his vexation of spirit shall David strike the stranger and cast him out, but David be also cast out with him, carried out into a land of monsters and cannibals.

And they shall fall into the hands of an Amalekite and the stranger be maimed and they are bound for execution by fire. Yet I will not suffer that they shall perish, but shall save them, and will turn the fire of the Amalekite unto their deliverance.

And I will carry them upon a fiery, flying eagle and shall deliver them unto Zion. And the heart of David shall be softened, and he shall grant that the stranger sit with him upon his throne in judgment of the people for they are both beloved.
