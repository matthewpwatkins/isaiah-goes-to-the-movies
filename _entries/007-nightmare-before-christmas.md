I looked and beheld a ruler of a pleasant land who ruleth his people in peace, and he worships the God of Israel, and his stature is great. But lo, soldiers from a far place capture him and carrieth him away.

And he is brought before another king, great and terrible, who is born from fire, and his the people love him for the fear he worketh in the heart of all men. And his kingdom is as the valley of the shadow of death and he is jealous of the righteous ruler.

And he setteth himself up as the righteous ruler and cometh to the pleasant land with his chariot and he worketh death, and pestilence, and uncleanness, and all manner of abominations among the pleasant people and they be sore afraid at his coming.

Then shall he be repented in his heart for the wickedness he hath wrought. And he shall return again to his own land, and shall deliver up the captive ruler and restore him to his own land.

Then shall be heard a ho, ho from the land of the north, and the people that walked in darkness shall see a great light: they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them shall the light shine.
