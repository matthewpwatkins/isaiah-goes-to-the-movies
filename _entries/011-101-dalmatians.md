There is joy in the household for the children that are born unto Israel. But behold and lo, I shall take away their rejoicings and give unto them a great mourning and a howling.

For lo, a wicked woman hath risen up against my people, great and fearsome, and even her name shall be as the daughter of the evil one. And she weareth the flesh of her enemies upon her loins. Fire goeth into her mouth, and threatenings come out.

And the children of Israel she carrieth away captive into a far place. Nevertheless, I have set my watchmen upon the walls and in the hills, and they shall not hold their peace, but shall cry out day and night for the lost ones of my people.

But I will deliver my children by a mighty hand. Beasts shall I send to nourish them, and rivers shall I freeze for their crossing, and I shall change their appearance before their enemies; thou shall not be discovered, O captive ones.

And that wicked one shall I destroy, and the captives shall be restored to their own household. A great host shall they bring with them, even that Israel shall be amazed and wonder, 'Who has begotten these for me?'

And they all together shall be five score and one.
