I will try my servant harshly, for though he speak humbly, he seeketh to excel. He purposeth to write for the Lord, yet in his heart his is full of gross vanity, and he rejoiceth in the fall of this father.

So I will send another, and shall send him gifts surpassing the first, and he shall write wonderfully. Then shall first shall envy and shall find no peace; he turneth altogether from his covenant, and shall deal treacherously, and shall lie in wait to tear the other in pieces.

His soul is become as a dark shadow, his face is fearsome, even as black stone. And he shall snatch the words of the second. Yet I have forbidden it; I shall kill the second swiftly, and his words be cut short with his breath. And the first shall be vexed all the days.
