Thus saith the Lord, my people have forgotten me, and they remember not the covenant of their fathers, wherefore I will stretch out my hand and curse them grievously with a deep sleep.

Whereunto shall I liken the afflictions wherewith I shall afflict them? They are like a man who eateth all night but waketh empty, and he is killed in the evening yet in the morning he is alive unmarred. And I give him endless days, yet it is but one day, and all is vain.

Yet shall the man learn wisdom from his afflictions, and temperance from the scourge. He shall treasure the season the Lord doth give him continually, and in penitence shall he joy in his friends. And by and by I shall put a new heart into him.

Thus shall it be for my covenant people, O Israel, for when they receive with gratitude the new heart I shall put into them and remember the Lord their God, then shall their endless scourge be lifted and all nations shall rejoice with them.
