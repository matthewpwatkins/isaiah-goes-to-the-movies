Wo unto him who knows not the Lord, nor fears him. For he laboreth and maketh merry, he loveth and liveth, and thinketh he hath understanding.

But he alone is without knowledge. For he laboreth in the field of the Lord. And he maketh merry with his friends in the Lord's vineyard, and his friends are the servants of the Lord. And even his wife loveth him not, for she is not his, but is of the Lord. Even his whole life is in the hands of the Lord, and though all people know the Lord, yet he hath no understanding at all.

But in that day shall the Lord work marvelously, and the sun shall turn back, and he shall reveal himself unto that man, and the man's folly shall be manifest in the eyes of all nations in the day he cometh to understanding.

And he shall not be ashamed but shall speak unto the nations with a loud voice and shall bless them with fortune in all their works. Yeah, in the daytime, in the even, and in the night time shall he bless them and shall depart out of his kingdom more wise than before.
