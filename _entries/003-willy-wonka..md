In that day shall he that worketh in secret be manifest in the eyes of the people and say, truly ye shall see my curious works, yet not all. And he shall number the fingers of his hand and shall choose him lads and virgins of report, and his wonders shall he show them.

Yet not all are worthy before the Lord. The evil one ariseth out of the pit, and is jealous for their sakes. He shall whisper unto them with a sweet tongue, to tempt them to treachery. And they heed the iniquity of their fathers.

The young ones shall enter the temple and shall see and hear unspeakable things. But as their hearts are full of mischief, therefore the indignation of the Lord is upon them and he shall turn their mischief upon their own heads, and on their fathers.

One lad shall the Lord boil alive, for he polluteth the stream of the God of Israel. Another shall he press for her image is expanded in her own eyes. Another shall he grind down unto the dust, for his imaginations are expanded loftily, even unto blasphemy.

And another hath sought to purchase the wonders with money; She hath reviled against all and would not hear the counsel of any man. Where fore she is prideful above all, and the Lord shall cast her into a dark pit, and shall burn her alive with fire and her father with her.

One lad is led astray by his father, insomuch that they both seek to exalt themselves into heaven as if on the wings of eagles. Yet shall the lad repent of his folly and altogether spurn the evil one.

Then shall there be rejoicing in the land flowing with milk and honey and the worker of secret works shall take in the lad and he shall gain all, for he alone is worthy. And they together shall ascend above the mountains, where never man has gone.
