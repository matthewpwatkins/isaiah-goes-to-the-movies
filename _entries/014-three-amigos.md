I beheld a remnant of the house of Israel, and it was compassed about by Moabites, and they did assail her ruthlessly. And Israel did send a virgin to find honorable warriors to fight for them.

And the virgin saw great noble ones in vision, and they were from a foreign land. And when the vision closed, she did send forth and did plead with them that they might come and deliver Israel from the hands of the Moabites.

And they soldiers came and spoke valiantly. But when they saw the Moabites, they were affrighted, and did smite the knees together, and did flee from before the Moabites, for they had never before fought any man.

And Moab was stirred up to anger against Israel, and did perplex the remnant, and even did carry the virgin captive into his own land. And Israel mourned for her fair daughter and would not be comforted.

And the soldiers were wrought with compassion, and the Lord was with them. And they did go forth boldly unto the land of the Moabites and did fall upon them from the sky, and they did smite them with stones, and the fire of the Lord did come out of their hands and consume them.

And they mounted upon a great eagle and they delivered the virgin unto the remnant. But Moab sought revenge upon the remnant of Israel. Wherefore, the solider took the weak and simple of the people and did make a mighty army of soldiers like unto themselves.

And they did buffet the army of Moab insomuch that Moab was distressed on every hand, and did flee before the remnant of Israel. And the soldiers were found no more in that land.
