I heard the report of a mighty army. And their drums sounded as ten thousand horses and their trumps as the hosts of heaven, yet I saw not a soldier.

But behold the number of the years of the Lord did fill my vision, and I did count the number, even an hundred score.

And the fires did ascend to heaven and did shake there, because they were filled with the glory of the Lord.
