Lo, the king of Babylon, who regardeth not the Lord nor his people. For his heart is full of wickedness, delighting in whoredoms and oppression. His days are measured and he is found wanting. The Lord of Hosts shall cause his breath to depart from him even as he lieth.

And his counsellors hath purposed unto themselves to rule, and they hide their secret works from the people. Wherefore, they shall send, and shall find a servant, a man of a familiar countenance, and shall say unto him, Sit ye here and rule in his stead and regard not man.

But the servant is one from whom the spirit of the Lord hath not altogether departed. And he shall do justly unto the nation, and shall find favor in the eyes of the people. And the wicked ones shall be vexxed and shall lie in wait to destroy him.

But he shall discover their secret works in the eyes of the people and shall speak marvelously. But then shall he faint and his breath depart from him, yet his breath be in him. Yea, he shall die, and all the people see, and shall mourn him, yet he shall not be dead.
